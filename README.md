## Setup

if you want to run MACE-tutorial notebook, clone MACE-dev version from Nov 17 2023 (this shouldn't matter much since we are running just the forward)

git clone https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace
git checkout ed2c3ba45a9e4f7d2f632967f02c114ec9e374f0
git status #just to verify the version
```
